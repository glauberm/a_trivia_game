# A Trivia Game

It started out as an exercise about CSS 3D transforms, but I got excited and expanded it a bit, then it became a minigame where you answer questions from the [Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com/). I submitted it to the [Game Off 2018](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2018/rate/335109). Made using only vanilla JavaScript and lots of CSS.

## Running the development server

Clone the repository and then run:

```[bash]
npm install && npm start
```

To watch for changes in the CSS:

```[bash]
npm run watch-css
```
